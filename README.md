# Typing Statistics
A typing speed (WPM) calculator built in Python.

To launch the application, run the app.py file from the command line, your IDE, or numerous other methods.

------------------------
Project Requirements:
  1. Must have access to the following Python Standard Library modules:
      <br>time
      <br>random
  2. Must create/download a sample text file (I recommend a book from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>) as a .txt:
      <br>typing_text.txt, where paragraphs are seperated by a blank line. The more paragraphs, the less likely it is that you will have repeated texts, as the choice of paragraph is pseudo-randomized.
